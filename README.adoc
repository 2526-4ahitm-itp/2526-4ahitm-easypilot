NOTE: This README is subject to further change during development of the project

== 📘 Project Description

*EasyPilot* is a modular DIY drone/autopilot platform built around a Raspberry Pi.
It provides real-time telemetry, camera streaming, ESC/motor control, optional YOLOv8 object detection, and a safe experimentation environment for autonomous flight.

Main features:

* Raspberry Pi as the main compute unit
* Live video streaming (RTSP/MJPEG)
* Telemetry via WiFi or LoRa
* ESC/motor output control
* IMU-based stabilization (MPU6050/9250)
* Optional YOLO object detection pipeline
* Expandable ground-station interface

== 🛠️ Installation

=== 📦 Requirements

* Raspberry Pi 4 or newer
* Python 3.10+
* Pi Camera or USB Camera
* ESCs + motors
* IMU sensor (recommended)
* WiFi or LoRa module

---

=== 🐍 Install on Raspberry Pi
Clone the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/easypilot
cd easypilot
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Enable the camera:

```bash
sudo raspi-config
```

Navigate to *Interface Options → Camera*.

=== 📡 Telemetry Setup
Start the telemetry server:

```bash
python3 telemetry/telemetry_server.py
```

Connect from the ground station:

```bash
python3 telemetry/telemetry_client.py
```

== 🎥 Camera Streaming
Start the camera stream:

```bash
python3 camera/stream.py
```

This exposes an RTSP or MJPEG stream (defined in `config.yaml`).

== 🤖 YOLOv8 Object Detection
Run detection on live stream:

```bash
python3 vision/detect.py --source stream
```

Models are stored under `models/`.

== 🛩️ Motor / ESC Control
Arm the system:

```bash
python3 control/arm.py
```

Test output signals:

```bash
python3 control/test_output.py
```

== 🎓 How to Use

1. Start telemetry
2. Start camera stream
3. (Optional) start YOLO
4. Use ground station to control/monitor the drone
